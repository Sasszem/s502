TODO:
- (pre)process: lookup defines from opcodes
- process: check opcodes
- process: determine addr modes
- process: generate binsizes
- preprocess: defmul <name> <A> <B> <C> name=A*B+C
- preprocess: include
- preprocess: incbin
- refactor: rename descructors to free
- parse args (-D)
- add modular logging
- CSV reader for opcodes
- Disable logging of emtpty?
- enforce conventions
DONE:
- preprocess: print
- preprocess: printc
- preprocess: ifndef
- preprocess: ifbeq
- refactor: pass whole tokenslist to all token processor functions
  (so we can get rid of the "parent" pointer from list elements)

- BUG: first token not logged?
- BUG: token added 0?? - cause: not terminated by 0!!
- BUG: empty token's line number
- BUG: first token's source
(that was smashing 4 bugs with 2 LOC)

- bug: memory leak if program halted due to bad number
- logging: FAIL
- log: add error messages to every subtask

- goddamn decide who's responisility will it be to delete objects - free() or caller of free()?
  (also: do we need to get our hands on real objects or just pointers?)
  (I think the latter (pointers, free() deletes the object too) would be simpler, altough you'd need to set the pointers to NULL by hand...)
