Conventions

Naming
- everything in snake_case
- functions should start with module name

Structure

Objects
- no one should possess a direct instance of any object, only pointers
- constructors should return with a pointer, or NULL
- destructors (named free) should free ALL memory associated with the object
- deleting an object should always be at MOST 2 lines - calling object_free and setting the ptr to NULL (later can be omitted)

Error handling
- functions should return 0 to indicate success, or negative to indicate error
- most errors should cause the program to end
- error handling should still free all allocated resources (memory, files)
- all functions should signal their failed state on receiving an error, but the root cause should be distinct

Commenting
- All functions should have a docs comment specifying what they do, what they return and how they can fail

Misc:
- No globals
- Include guards on every file
